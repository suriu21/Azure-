**What is Cloud?**

In simple terms, Cloud as a vast, Virtual space where you can store files, run Software and access various services over the internet.

It's like having a powerful computer somewhere out there on the web that you can use for tasks without needing to own or physically manage the hardware. This allows users to access data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection.

**What is Cloud Computing?**

Cloud computing is a technology model that involves the delivery of computing services over the internet. Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers and infrastructure, users can access and use computing resources, applications, and storage provided by either third-party service providers (public cloud) or their own organization (private cloud) through the internet. These services are hosted in data centers located around the world.

In essence, cloud computing can involve both third-party providers (public cloud) and an organization's internal resources (private cloud). The distinction lies in whether the computing resources are shared among multiple customers (public cloud) or dedicated to a single organization (private cloud). The flexibility of cloud computing allows organizations to choose the deployment model that best aligns with their needs and requirements.

**Public Cloud:**

Who Uses It: Everyone, like individuals, businesses, and organizations.

What It's Like: Imagine a giant, shared computer space on the internet. It's like using apps, storing files, or doing tasks on the internet that anyone can access.

Example: Think of Google Drive or Amazon Web Services (AWS).

**Private Cloud:**

Who Uses It: One specific organization or business.

What It's Like: Picture having your own personal, private computer space. It's like a digital clubhouse where only you and your team have access. Others can't just drop in.

Example: A company using its own server for all its digital needs.

**Hybrid Cloud:**

Who Uses It: A mix of everyone, depending on needs.

What It's Like: It's like having your private computer space, but sometimes you use the shared internet space too.

Example: A business storing sensitive data in its private space but using the public cloud for extra storage or specific tasks.


**What types of cloud services are available?**

There are three main cloud computing services, Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** is the core category of cloud services. IaaS is rented IT infrastructure from a third-party cloud provider. Within your IT infrastructure, you will be able to rent servers, network, storage, virtual machines and more. 

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)** is a cloud computing service that offers an environment for you to develop, test, deliver and manage your software applications with ease. With PaaS, it has never been easier for developers to create applications without having to worry about the setup of your underlying IaaS, storage, network and databases needed for development. 

**Software as a Service (SaaS)** is a method for delivering your software applications over the internet. This would be offered as an on–demand service on a subscription basis. Your cloud provider will host and manage the software application and infrastructure. They will also take care of any maintenance e.g. software upgrades or any security patching that’s needed. You can connect to the applications over the Internet via your browser on your PC, phone or tablet.
