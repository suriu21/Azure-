What is Cloud?
In simple terms, Cloud as a vast, Virtual space where you can store files, run Software and access various services over the internet.

It's like having a powerful computer somewhere out there on the web that you can use for tasks without needing to own or physically manage the hardware. This allows users to access data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection.
